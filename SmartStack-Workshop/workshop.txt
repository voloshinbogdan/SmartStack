description=This mod adds two convenient buttons to the loot panel and inventory context menu, making it easy to resupply your containers with just one click - similar to Terraria's "Quick Stack" feature.
description=- The "Stack" button moves items from your inventory into the selected loot container.
description=- The "To All" button stacks items into all currently available loot containers.
description=Both buttons only transfer items already present in the loot containers. They automatically exclude favorites, equipped items, and items stored in the key ring.
description=They also can be bound to desired hotkeys in key binding settings in game's menu or disabled in menu Mods > SmartStack (disabling is only for Build 42+).
