id=SmartStack
description=This mod adds two convenient buttons to the loot panel and inventory context menu, making it easy to resupply your containers with just one click â€” similar to Terraria's "Quick Stack" feature.
description=- The "Stack" button moves items from your inventory into the selected loot container.
description=- The "To All" button stacks items into all currently available loot containers.
description=Both buttons only transfer items already present in the loot containers. They automatically exclude favorites, equipped items, and items stored in the key ring.
